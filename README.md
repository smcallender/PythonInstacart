# Instacart Python Project  


Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. 
# Objective
My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
